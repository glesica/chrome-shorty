Chrome extension that shortens and copies the current URL.

There are two ways to use the extension:

1) Click the little chain-link looking button (I'm not an artist, 
so get over it). This will shorten the current URL and show you 
the short URL. It will also copy the short URL to the clipboard.

2) Press Ctrl-Shift-X. This will shorten the current URL and copy 
the shortened version to the clipboard.
